# Duplicate Checker
Just a simple tool that I used to clean my BeatSaber levels.   
Have any suggestion, please submit a issue.

## Usage

```shell
# Get command list: 
DuplicateChecker -help

# Clean target folder by multiple sample folders (auto confirm)  
DuplicateChecker -t "your/target/folder" -s "your/sample/folder1" -s "your/sample/folder2" -y

```
